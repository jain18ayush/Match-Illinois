User,Project Description
7,AI powered chat filter
9,something to do with neural networks and possibly game dev.  
11,Real-Time ASL Translation App
12,"Creating an iOS app (perhaps named ""Third Eye"") that employs CoreML, CreateML, or similar technologies to develop and train a robust traffic sign detection model. This app seamlessly integrates with the device's camera, enabling real-time traffic sign recognition. Users receive alerts for speeding violations and missing crucial traffic signs. The app also leverages the phone's accelerometer data to monitor speed, comparing it to posted speed limits. Additionally, it offers audio announcements for important signs like STOP signs and logs multiple traffic signs on a single route, updating speed limits as they change."
34,"2D Role-playing game that incorporates turn-based combat sort of in the sense of the early Final Fantasy games, for strategy."
35,"I was thinking of doing data processing and prediction via machine learning with Python as the primary language, kind of similar to Kaggle. I'm considering of doing something related to biology or finance. Maybe use python (numpy, pandas) to gather data, process data and utilize pytorch to build a deep learning model in solving these issues."
41,"My project idea is a Recipe Finder. The idea is that people, particularly students, could input ingredients that they have in their homes or refrigerators, and possibly the appliances they have at their disposal, and based on data from various online resources and cookbooks, the website could return a recipe that fits the ingredients and appliances the person inputted. It could also return a similarity score (eg: the recipe is 80% match for the ingredients). I am potentially thinking of adding nutrition facts as well, so that the recipes returned could address daily nutritional needs. "
45,"Simple Portfolio Tracker and Analyzer that allows users to track and analyze the performance of their investment portfolio.

Basically it would take the financial information from Venmo, cash app, Zelle, Depop, Ebay, PayPal, Etsy, the income made from social media apps and whatever banking apps you use and makes it easily available and understandable. It also could have a feature where you can log where all spending goes, like going further than at the normal spending categories of like food, clothing, rent, but tracks costs of specific things, which can then be used to track expenses for small businesses or just for people trying to cut back on specific things.
