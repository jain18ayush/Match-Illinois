User,Project Description
4,A simple game.
12,"Creating an iOS app (perhaps named ""Third Eye"") that employs CoreML, CreateML, or similar technologies to develop and train a robust traffic sign detection model. This app seamlessly integrates with the device's camera, enabling real-time traffic sign recognition. Users receive alerts for speeding violations and missing crucial traffic signs. The app also leverages the phone's accelerometer data to monitor speed, comparing it to posted speed limits. Additionally, it offers audio announcements for important signs like STOP signs and logs multiple traffic signs on a single route, updating speed limits as they change."

For instance, a light job would have a different list of songs than a sprint. Also, if a person is doing weights, they could use a playlist that includes the number of songs as the number of sets and the song switches every time a person starts a new set. This could be indicated to the app by either voice detection, touch on the screen, press of a button, or time. "
