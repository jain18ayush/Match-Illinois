69,"An interesting project would be to do something similar to the software product J.P. Morgan use for their trading desk.

The details and specific use case can be determent later in the group. However, I believe this project would be a good simulation for what modern real-world project would entrain, complex front-end and many customization,  back-end that has a high throughput and is high-frequency, and potential cloud distributed implementation for serviceability and maintainability."
