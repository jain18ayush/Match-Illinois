User,Project Description
1,My project idea is to make a calendar or task manager.
3,"I want to build an algorithm that pairs individuals based on their compatibility in terms of personality and political views and how well they would get along. For work partnering, school partnering, dating apps, etc."
4,A simple game.
7,AI powered chat filter
10,A bike lending app
17,An application for students to find different study groups and their locations on a map. This could be helpful if students want to do work for a specific class together. 
19,A Dining Hall social media platform that allows students to share their food experiences and wait times at the dining halls. 
32,It's an interactive video game basically like Pacman.
41,"My project idea is a Recipe Finder. The idea is that people, particularly students, could input ingredients that they have in their homes or refrigerators, and possibly the appliances they have at their disposal, and based on data from various online resources and cookbooks, the website could return a recipe that fits the ingredients and appliances the person inputted. It could also return a similarity score (eg: the recipe is 80% match for the ingredients). I am potentially thinking of adding nutrition facts as well, so that the recipes returned could address daily nutritional needs. "
49,The project would be a website visualization of Illini-Alert.
54,"A daily route planner for UIUC students. Use campus map to identify places to rest (libraries, classrooms, etc) based on class schedule, dining hall timings. Starts and ends at home. Suggests best modes of transport (uses average walking time?). "
65,"A program where if somebody calls the user and user doesn't pick up, program will check microsoft / google calendrer and if user is in the middle of a event or meeting , a automatic  notification will be sent telling person who originally called when user is likely available "
69,"An interesting project would be to do something similar to the software product J.P. Morgan use for their trading desk. It is called Perspective and can be seen here, it is open-sourced: https://perspective.finos.org/. Data visualization components and gaining insight from big data sources is something that is versatile in many cases, from trading, spatial analysis, corporate consumer insight for example. The details and specific use case can be determent later in the group. However, I believe this project would be a good simulation for what modern real-world project would entrain, complex front-end and many customization,  back-end that has a high throughput and is high-frequency, and potential cloud distributed implementation for serviceability and maintainability."
