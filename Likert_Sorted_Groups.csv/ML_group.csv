User,Project Description
1,My project idea is to make a calendar or task manager.

4,A simple game.
8,Skin Cancer Detection Program
10,A bike lending app
15,"My first project idea is a UIUC event locator. You would basically be able to go through a list of all of the events being held that day (RSOs, Office hours, Info Meetings, etc). You'd find all of the event details (time, location, bus) in one place. "
19,A Dining Hall social media platform that allows students to share their food experiences and wait times at the dining halls. 
23,"SignIFY' - Real-time Language Translation for Sign Language. I would like to create a system that can translate sign language gestures into spoken language in real time, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing."
30,"- CollegeConnect 
- App that pairs high school students with college students via messaging so that they can ask any questions they might have"
33,Paper Trading Web App: A platform with the same functionality as a real investing website but uses fake money. The app would allow the user to actively manage a portfolio and execute trades in real-time in a simulated environment. 
41,"My project idea is a Recipe Finder. The idea is that people, particularly students, could input ingredients that they have in their homes or refrigerators, and possibly the appliances they have at their disposal, and based on data from various online resources and cookbooks, the website could return a recipe that fits the ingredients and appliances the person inputted. It could also return a similarity score (eg: the recipe is 80% match for the ingredients). I am potentially thinking of adding nutrition facts as well, so that the recipes returned could address daily nutritional needs. "
45,"Simple Portfolio Tracker and Analyzer that allows users to track and analyze the performance of their investment portfolio. Users should be able to input their investment holdings, including stock tickers, purchase prices, and quantities. The program should then provide various quantitative metrics and visualizations to help users assess their portfolio's performance."

69,"An interesting project would be to do something similar to the software product J.P. Morgan use for their trading desk. It is called Perspective and can be seen here, it is open-sourced: https://perspective.finos.org/. Data visualization components and gaining insight from big data sources is something that is versatile in many cases, from trading, spatial analysis, corporate consumer insight for example. The details and specific use case can be determent later in the group. However, I believe this project would be a good simulation for what modern real-world project would entrain, complex front-end and many customization,  back-end that has a high throughput and is high-frequency, and potential cloud distributed implementation for serviceability and maintainability."
70,"TweetStreet

This project aims to analyze Twitter data to assess market sentiment and its potential impact on stock prices. It involves collecting and analyzing tweets related to financial markets to provide insights into the sentiment trends and their correlation with stock price movements."

136,"I think it would be cool to have an app that makes a playlist based on the workout a person is going. The app would be tailored to the workout's type, length, and level of difficulty. For instance, a light job would have a different list of songs than a sprint. Also, if a person is doing weights, they could use a playlist that includes the number of songs as the number of sets and the song switches every time a person starts a new set. This could be indicated to the app by either voice detection, touch on the screen, press of a button, or time. "
140,"I will be creating an isometric puzzle game with a slight story element. I hope to create a game that focuses on the perspective of a character from a (currently undecided) Shakespeare play, and the puzzles will reflect their journey throughout the story. The final project would resemble some of those cheap movie-to-game ports on handheld consoles."
141,"COVID-19 heat map based on different demographics

An app or website that displays a simple multiplication problem (i.e. 12 x 12, 4 x 6, etc.) and the user has to answer as many as they can in a certain time span (like 1 minute). Could be expanded to cover division and other math problems if we have time"
242,"This project would be a scheduling app for my high school. Right now, my high school uses an app called Saturn, but recently Saturn has raised privacy and bullying concerns. If I can make an app that is specifically for my school(with the mascot and school pride slogans, similar to the Illinois App), then maybe my principal would consider it. If not, I could simply remove the high school aspect of it and make it a scheduling app for anything. Although there are many scheduling apps out there, I would get good practice out of this and I could also add features that you would otherwise have to pay for if you were to want one on the app store."
