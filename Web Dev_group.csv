48,An App that takes user input in order to recommend local restaurants and dishes based on your preferences 
51,"This project idea is based off a project I worked on with a team in high school for a competition. The demo made for the competition wasn't made public, but this project could become a web application that is publicly accessible for a larger impact. 

This project would be a data visualization dashboard that shows disparities in voter turnout. The visualization would consist of a map of the US, split into states. By default, the states would be shaded according to overall voter registration (with darker shading indicating a higher registration percentage). Users could also look at voter turnout or ease-of-voting instead of registration. Toggles would be included so that users can fine-tune what population they are looking at by race, gender, and age.

For example, a user can choose to only look at each state’s Latinx and African American populations or only look at each state’s female population. With the toggles, users can look at demographics with great precision. For example, a user could look at something as specific as the ease-of-voting for the female African American population between 18-24 years old."

69,"An interesting project would be to do something similar to the software product J.P. Morgan use for their trading desk. It is called Perspective and can be seen here, it is open-sourced: https://perspective.finos.org/. Data visualization components and gaining insight from big data sources is something that is versatile in many cases, from trading, spatial analysis, corporate consumer insight for example. The details and specific use case can be determent later in the group. However, I believe this project would be a good simulation for what modern real-world project would entrain, complex front-end and many customization,  back-end that has a high throughput and is high-frequency, and potential cloud distributed implementation for serviceability and maintainability."

If I can make an app that is specifically for my school(with the mascot and school pride slogans, similar to the Illinois App), then maybe my principal would consider it. If not, I could simply remove the high school aspect of it and make it a scheduling app for anything. Although there are many scheduling apps out there, I would get good practice out of this and I could also add features that you would otherwise have to pay for if you were to want one on the app store."
