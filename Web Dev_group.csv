78,"An integrative uiuc app which allows you to meet freshman and other students studying in the campus, you can view their major, where they are dorming at and what their intrests are.

136,"I think it would be cool to have an app that makes a playlist based on the workout a person is going. The app would be tailored to the workout's type, length, and level of difficulty. For instance, a light job would have a different list of songs than a sprint. Also, if a person is doing weights, they could use a playlist that includes the number of songs as the number of sets and the song switches every time a person starts a new set. This could be indicated to the app by either voice detection, touch on the screen, press of a button, or time. "
140,"I will be creating an isometric puzzle game with a slight story element. I hope to create a game that focuses on the perspective of a character from a (currently undecided) Shakespeare play, and the puzzles will reflect their journey throughout the story.
