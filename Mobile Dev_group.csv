51,"This project idea is based off a project I worked on with a team in high school for a competition. The demo made for the competition wasn't made public, but this project could become a web application that is publicly accessible for a larger impact. This project would be a data visualization dashboard that shows disparities in voter turnout. The visualization would consist of a map of the US, split into states. By default, the states would be shaded according to overall voter registration (with darker shading indicating a higher registration percentage). Users could also look at voter turnout or ease-of-voting instead of registration. Toggles would be included so that users can fine-tune what population they are looking at by race, gender, and age. For example, a user can choose to only look at each state’s Latinx and African American populations or only look at each state’s female population. With the toggles, users can look at demographics with great precision. For example, a user could look at something as specific as the ease-of-voting for the female African American population between 18-24 years old."
